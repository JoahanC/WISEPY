# WISEPY

WISEPY is a code base that serves to manipulate data from the WISE GATOR catalog and the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center database. As a facet of the NEOWISE mission, it principally acts as a tool through which to recover missing observations from the WISE catalog through manual methods.

## General Requirements

WISEPY makes use of Linux commands when interacting with files, and as such, is not written to be run on a non-Linux based environment. Python is the only language used and I recommend using a conda installation to set up all of the packages used in this tool. Apple computers likely already come with a version of Python installed. **DO NOT USE THIS!** Make sure your Python is up to date.
